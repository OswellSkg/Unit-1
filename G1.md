# Criteria A: Planning
## Problem definition
Ms. Sato is a local trader who is interested in the emerging market of cryptocurrencies. She has started to buy and sell electronic currencies, however at the moment she is tracking all his transaction using a ledger in a spreadsheet which is starting to become burdensome and too disorganized. It is also difficult for Ms Sato to find past transactions or important statistics about the currency. Ms Sato is in need of a digital ledger that helps her track the amount of the cryptocurrency, the transactions, along with useful statistics.

Apart for this requirements, Ms Sato is open to explore a cryptocurrency selected by the developer.

## Proposed Solution
Design statement: I will to design and make a **Crypto Wallet** for a client who is **a local trader**. The **project** will be about **helping her track the amoutn of the cryptocurrency, the transactions, along with useful statistics** and is constructed using the software **Python 3.10.8**. It will take **about 3 weeks** to make and will be evaluated according to the criteria **shown below**.

The digital coin used will be USD Tether.
Tether(USDT) is an asset-backed cryptocurrency stablecoin created by iFinex Inc. in 2014.
Tether's history goes back to a dollar-backed cryptocurrency "realcoin" which was used to transfer fiat currencies on the blockchain. 
It was then rebranded to Tether to what is known today, a coin that provides stable price point to that of USD at all times. 
Tether functions as the digital USD.
