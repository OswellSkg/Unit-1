# Criteria A: Planning
## Problem definition
Ms. Sato is a local trader who is interested in the emerging market of cryptocurrencies. She has started to buy and sell electronic currencies, however at the moment she is tracking all his transaction using a ledger in a spreadsheet which is starting to become burdensome and too disorganized. It is also difficult for Ms Sato to find past transactions or important statistics about the currency. Ms Sato is in need of a digital ledger that helps her track the amount of the cryptocurrency, the transactions, along with useful statistics.

Apart for this requirements, Ms Sato is open to explore a cryptocurrency selected by the developer.

## Proposed Solution
Design statement: I will to design and make an **Electric Ledger/Crypto Wallet** for a client who is **a local trader(Ms. Sato)**. The **project** will be about **helping her track the amoutn of the cryptocurrency, the transactions, along with useful statistics** and is constructed using the software **Python 3.10.8**. It will take **about 3 weeks** to make and will be evaluated according to the criteria **shown below**.

The digital coin used will be USD Tether.
Tether(USDT) is an asset-backed cryptocurrency stablecoin created by iFinex Inc. in 2014.
Tether's history goes back to a dollar-backed cryptocurrency "realcoin" which was used to transfer fiat currencies on the blockchain. 
It was then rebranded to Tether to what is known today, a coin that provides stable price point to that of USD at all times. 
Tether functions as the digital USD. 

## Justification to proposed solution

USDT is a stable cryptocurrency that is correlated to that of the United States Dollar. Since Ms. Sato is not an experienced trader in cryptocurrency, this stability can bring her a chance to gain experience without a big loss. The USDT can also provide Ms. Sato with an opportunity to further explore and experiment with cryptocurrency of how it works and how it converts to real-life currencies, without any worries that other cryptocurrencies may bring to her. 

I will use the software Python3 to program my digital ledger. Firstly, this is due to the code-readability emphasized syntax of Python that brings efficiency and flexibility to the developer, myself. By using Python3, it allows me and the program to be very sustainable as the software gives me access to easy-maintanance of the program for long-term uses. Secondly, Python3 encourages developers a Test Driven Development style, also known as TDD. This means that Python3 allows me to swiftly create a prototype of the digital ledger, and shape it to become more solid in favor of my client. For that reason, with Python3, I can be more client-friendly and reflect their wills on my program. Thirdly and lastly, Python3 is very commonly used for data analytics. The language will help me and my client to easily work with datas, and easily organize the finances of my client. 


## Success Criteria
1. The electronic ledger is a text-based software (Runs in the Terminal).
2. The electronic ledger display the basic description of the cyrptocurrency selected.
3. The electronic ledger allows to enter, withdraw and record transactions.
4. The electronic ledger password protected to ensure privacy and safety. 
5. The electronic ledger shows the 10 most recent transactions. 
6. The electronic ledger time that the transaction was made.

[Approved]
